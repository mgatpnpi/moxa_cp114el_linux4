The Smartio/Industio/UPCI/PCIe Linux driver supports Linux Kernel 2.6 
===============================================================
2-10-'06

1. The first Moxa driver which support 
   Kernel 2.6 is Ver1.8. Ver1.9 begins to
   support x64.

2. The difference under 2.6 and 2.4:
   a. The cum* device is obsolete. That is,
      you can't use cum* device under kernel
      2.6. 

   b. In some distribution, the tty port will
      be disappeared at next boot. You can
      run msmknod (in driver path) again to solve 
      this problem. That is, you can put the 
      msmknod into boot script. Please refer the
      rc.mxser for more information. Moxa will
      fix this problem in next release.

3. How to load driver:
	Old method:
	# insmod mxser

	From ver1.8 on 2.4 and 2.6: 
	# modprobe mxser

4. If any compatible issue, please contact
   support@moxa.com
